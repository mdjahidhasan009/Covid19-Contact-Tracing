### Covid 19 contact tracing using Bluetooth Low Energy
In this project, we are trying to get potential covid 19 patients using contract tracing of already covid 19 affected people.
- Keep track of nearby users using Bluetooth Low
Energy technology.
- If any nearby user report positive, it will warn others nearby
users to do Covid-19 test as soon as possible.
- Statistics of Covid-19 worldwide and country wise using
API
- User will turn on isolation mode if he/she tested positive.
- User will turn on covid guard if he/she want to get warning was there any Covid positive people around him.
